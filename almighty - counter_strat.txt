My personal strategies for fighting Almighty SB and what everything is balanced around
 * All tactics here are assuming no bonus difficulty activation.

Required Mods:

 - Gigas for Supertensiles.
 - AOT for Phanon Greatwall.
 - SOTS for Theta Tech + Soulsphere (mainly for Pure Runic production, just AOT can do economy).

Prep Phase:

 - Large Buffer of AI Empires / Bait Planets to buy time.
 - Max out on all tech (no need for repeatable).
 - Maximum of 4 choke points leading to empire core.
 - Phanon Greatwall & Bastion fitted SOTS Starbase in Chokepoints.
 - Full Soul Devourer fitted Phanon Megaturrets for Greatwall.
 - +1k or higher supertensile income (to rebuild lost Megaturrets in time).
 - Enough stuff to rebuild all lost fleets in around 3-6 months.
 - Stack enough ship build speed to rapid reinforce to do that.
 - Minimum of 150 shipyards per maxed out fleet.
 - Around 1800 shipyards empire wide (Assuming 14 fleets to be comfy).
 - Grab a calculator and do the math yourself if needed, don't get lazy.
 - Around +1m research points / month or higher.
 - It is recommended to colonize planets on the greatwall even if you don't need it (auto rebuild starbase outpost).

Fleet Composition:

 - 80 Battlecruisers + 40 Hyperions (2:1 ratio, 2k fleet command limit from gigas, acot defines only give 1k).
 - Each fleet with silly max leveled Admirals and too many traits.
 - 10 fleets if you can get ridiculous admirals, 14 fleets for vanilla admirals (or to be comfy).
 - Hyperions with Soul Devourer T slots, best weapons with 100% tracking + accuracy for everything else.
 - Balanced Shields, Armor, Hull + Aux Slots full of Afterburners.
 - Need 2.5k - 3k speed after bonuses apply. Inspect ship manually for accurate stat (ship designer don't show it).
 - Celestial ships like Planetcrafts / Systemcrafts / Herculeans are usually not worth it (use at your own risk).
 - If you do decide to use Quasarcraft, be careful and send proper escort fleet (Mod not balanced around them).
 - Expect to get fleet wiped multiple times over and be ready to instantly rebuild them within 3-6 months.
 - Total naval cap usage will be around: 12k - 16k depending on what else you got.


Combat Tactics
________________________

Just before & after spawning:

 - Get everything out of the outergate systems, move all fleets / ships behind your chokepoints.
 - Give up on the rest of the galaxy (including your own planets outside chokepoints).
 - If you have Wormholes / L-Gates leading inside your chokepoint held space, give up on life!
 
 - Depending on your readiness, hotkey / split up fully upgraded fleets into ~4 offensive divisions.
 - If your Greatwalls are not ready yet, assign some fleets for garrison duty.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * Escalation waves are triggered by number of ships killed & time passed.
 * DO NOT ENTER THE OUTER CLUSTER UNTIL YOU ARE READY OR FACE PUNISHMENT! Forbid the entry system!

Wave 1 (Escorts Fleets):

 * The easiest wave to deal with, they mainly exist to be farmed by people who don't have SOTS installed.
 - Use your 4 offensive divisions and start picking off individual fleets simultaneously.
 - Make sure you have enough fleet power to win against around 3 fleets combined in case of ambush.
 - Stellarborn ships are very fast but they tend to target planets more than ships.
 - Try to predict their movements with this fact and jump drive ahead of them if you can't catch.
 
 - Stop farming them when the Stellarborn contact you, do the special project, research static light reactor.
 - Go back to farming and start harvesting light matter, keep an eye out for kill count.
 
Wave 2 (Battlecruiser Escalation):

 * Stellarborn will despawn all of their Wave 1 Escorts when it triggers so any combat will stop.
 - Jump drive all offensive fleets back inside your chokepoints the instant you get notified.
 
 - If you have enough research unlocked, bunker down behind the Greatwalls and do those.
 - Take the time to tech rush toward X slot and T slot weapons you need to upgrade the Greatwall Megaturrets.
 - Only go on the offensive if you are confident and make sure to death stack them (No more solo fleets).
 - The main reason the fight now is to unlock all the static light techs. If you don't need them don't fight.
 
 - Escalation will trigger faster if you kill more ships so stall Wave 3 for as long as possible and prepare.
 - Once everything is ready, start killing and trigger wave 3 (hopefully on purpose).

Wave 3 (Hyperion Escalation):

 - When this hits keep an eye on your Greatwalls! There is a good chance they will break and especially the Starbase!
 - Slowly withdraw fleets from the Greatwalls to test their strength. Be ready to intervene with fleets if they start to crack.
 - Once you are sure the Greatwalls can hold, do some offensive runs and finish all static light techs if you don't have them all.

 * Be super careful now as a single Stellarborn Hyperion have to power of celestial fleets.
 * As each AI Empire / buffer zone falls, their attacks will become more focused on you. Your Omega Greatwalls will start to slowly crack.
 - Use your massive supertensile production to restore them faster than they die, reinforce fleets as soon as they get wiped.
 - Build up a solid force while defending and prepare to attack the outer cluster.

Outer Cluster:

 * Another type Escalation, no notification, triggered as soon as anything enter the outer cluster
 * More ships will spawn in an attempt to kick you out of it but it have an invisible cooldown.

 - The instant you enter the outer cluster, LEAVE! You really don't want that wave.
 - Get back, bait them into the Greatwall and kill them along with all attacking fleets.
 - There is a cooldown before attack waves can respawn, if you kill them all there will be a downtime.
 
 - Use that downtime to go on the offensive, pick off worlds one by one.
 - Recommended to use one sacrificial fleet for bombardment and retreat the rest to chokepoints.
 - When the bombardment fleet falls as the new attack waves spawn, quickly replace it before devastation ticks down.
 - Finish off all the worlds.
 
NOTES: 
 * Stay away from the final boss system (you'll now when you see it).
 * When all worlds are destroyed, they will not be able to respawn offensive fleets thus weakening the crisis.
 * The worlds MUST be bombarded! DO NOT attempt to invade them, if you can that is a bug.

Arkship Final Boss:

 - Build up around 14 static light fleets, throw them at it around 2-3 times.
 - You will get fleet wiped but should win the second time assuming you do enough damage.
 - Check situation log for how many lives it have.
 - If you have enough damage, it can be killed within a month.
 - If you have universe ending damage, it can be paralyzed so it won't shoot back most of the time.

 - Herculeans surrounding it usually don't fight back but sometimes they do. Depends on the mood.
 - They mainly act as distractions and drawing your fire toward useless targets if they don't outright fight you.
 - Your goal here is to SNIPE the Arkship, nothing else matters.
 - Once lives fall below a threshold, Almost ALL Stellarborn ships still exist in the galaxy will be mass recalled.
 - So it is recommended to kill everything else off outside the system before you engage.
 
Congrats you won:

 - Now go outside and have a cupcake!

Minor Notes:

 * Almighty Stellarbone use omega section precursor ships with flowing light modules.
 * There are 3 waves in total: Escorts, Battlecruisers, and Hyperions.
 * Each ship use only one weapon type for damage & no strike crafts or point defense.
 * For each escalation: all weapons & defensive modules get upgraded as well so its not just ships getting bigger.
 * The only exception for this is their starbases which use static light missiles (T slot Megumin missiles).
 * The outer cluster starbases have defensive stations with X slot Speedwagon missiles.
 * While they expand into surrounding systems, starbases do not have FLT inhibitors as they'll be just painful.
 * If you lose a system and they expand into it, a construction ship with an escort can reclaim it after the second time.
 * You need to instantly kill the station and start building your own, the time margin is very narrow but you can do it.
